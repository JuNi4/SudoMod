# Sudo

A Minecraft mod that adds a little command from linux called sudo.

* All of these commands don't actually do anything. It's just a joke command.

## Usage:
```
# pretends to install a package (requires root)
/$ sudo apt-get install <package name>
# pretends to remove a package (requires root)
/$ sudo apt-get remove <package name>
# lists all installed packages
/$ apt-get list

# set the package repo (none = no packages being installable, dev = sometimes, default = all) (requires root)
/$ sudo add-apt-repository [none/dev/default]
# updates the database of available packages (requires root)
/$ sudo apt update

# prints a directory tree
/$ tree

# prints information about the system
/$ neofetch
```

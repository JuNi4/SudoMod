# Sudo

A Minecraft mod that adds a little command from linux called sudo.

* All of these commands don't actually do anything. It's just a joke command.

## Usage:
```
# pretends to install a package
/sudo apt install <package name>
# pretends to remove a package
/sudo apt remove <package name>

# prints a directory tree
/sudo tree
```
